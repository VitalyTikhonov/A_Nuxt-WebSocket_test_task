Hi! I'm making a mock Nuxt.js app sending a message to PieSocket and logging the response to my page. But PieSocket seems to progressively multiply the number of responses. Could you please advise me on what might be wrong?

– Customer Support
Hello there. You might be making multiple connections
– Customer Support
To check this, open developer tools and go to the network tab
– Customer Support
Then filter "ws" to see if you are making multiple connections.
I have been observing the network tab as well as console-logging every onmessage event. And upon every UI triggered response there are one query appearing on Network and N onmessage console logs, where N is the ordnal number of my UI trigger hits

– Customer Support
How many connections can you see there, can you please send a screenshot of the ws connections list.

this is hitting the UI trigger #1

Are you using PieSocketJS?
– Customer Support
or any other WebSocket library
https://ucarecdn.com/1d159591-e2a9-49d3-909b-4f7cc8cfa44f/-/resize/235x/
this is hitting it second time. Please note one extra onmessage in the console

There should not be two connections as you see, this is the reason you are getting multiple connections
– Customer Support
Are you using PieSockerJs library?
I think I am using another WebSocket library in parallel

PieSocketJS? Not quite  understanding what you mean

I just used the code by analogy to the one for frontend side here https://www.piesocket.com/docs/3.0/javascript-client

– Customer Support
Hold on I will link you to it
– Customer Support
https://www.npmjs.com/package/piesocket-js
– Customer Support
You can use this library
https://ucarecdn.com/182eceaa-a408-4e24-bb2d-c87146f2f7a6/-/resize/235x/
– Customer Support
or
– Customer Support
you can move the connection code
– Customer Support
outside actions
– Customer Support
at the top
– Customer Support
and it will not trigger twice
– Customer Support
and work as expected
– Customer Support
What I mean is, assign piesocket = new WebSocket.... just below websocketOrgTracker = 0
I see, thank you, perhaps I will try it

Which two connections did you mean ?

– Customer Support
In this screenshot I can see two connections, which sould not be the case.
– Customer Support
It is happening because actions is called multiple times and so WebSocket connection is created once again.
– Customer Support
The solution above will fix it
Mm, my UI trigger is clicking a tab. You mean there should be only one piesocket connection opening per user's website session?

– Customer Support
Yes, once evey page load or website session in case of single page applications.
and not one onopen per each reopening of the tab

– Customer Support
correct
